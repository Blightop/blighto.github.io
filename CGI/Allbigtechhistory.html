                <h2><i class="ri-google-fill"></i>OOGLE</h2>
                <p>In 2017, the European Commission imposed a record fine of <span class="hightlight">€2.42 billion</span> on the company for using its dominant position, which resulted in an antitrust action by this particular player </p>
                <p>In 2020, Google was sued by the US Department of Justice and State Attorneys General for <span class="hightlight">engaging in anticompetitive behaviour</span> that resulted to its monopolisation of the internet search and search advertising markets. They argue that Google's dominance is the result of pay-to-play deals, in which the company spends billions to guarantee that its search engine is preinstalled on devices, keeping out rivals. </p>
                <p>In the same year, Texas and other states sued Google for <span class="hightlight">monopolising the digital advertising business, claiming anticompetitive tactics that hampered competition and innovation</span>. The lawsuit claims Google of underpaying publishers and overcharging advertisers, linking its services to keep competitors out, and collaborating with Facebook in the "Jedi Blue" arrangement to rig ad auctions. The legal proceedings have included many changes to the case, a failed Google transfer effort, and a discovery and trial timeline that extends until 2025. </p>
                <p>In December 2020, 38 states led by Colorado and Nebraska filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing it of <span class="hightlight">monopolizing internet search and search-related advertising</span>. The suit, which was consolidated with a DOJ case, claims Google maintains its monopoly through exclusionary agreements with device manufacturers and restrictive practices that favor its search engine over competitors. The states <span class="hightlight"></span>seek structural changes to restore competition, potentially requiring Google to divest parts of its business.</p>
                <p>In 2021, Utah led 36 states in filing a lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California. They accused Google of <span class="hightlight">monopolizing the smartphone application and payment systems by using restrictive contracts and technological barriers</span>, similar to conduct penalized by the EU. The lawsuit highlights Google’s payments to manufacturers to pre-install and prioritize Google Play, making it difficult for alternative app stores and payment systems to compete.</p>
                <div id="Facebook"></div>
                <h2><i class="ri-meta-line"></i>FACEBOOK</h2>
                <p>In 2020, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Facebook, alleging that the company is <span class="hightlight">illegally maintaining a monopoly in personal social networking</span> through its conduct. According to the FTC, Facebook is guilty of snuffing out competition—chiefly Instagram and WhatsApp—once it has identified them as threats to its empire and offered them the classic deal they cannot refuse.</p>
                <div id="Apple"></div>
                <h2><i class="ri-apple-line"></i>APPLE</h2>
                <p>Furthermore, a conflict arose when Epic Games challenged Apple's App Store standards in 2020, namely the mandatory in-app payment mechanism, after Apple <span class="hightlight">withdrew Fortnite from the App Store for violating its pricing structure</span>. The court mandated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from directing users to alternative payment systems, though it did not classify Apple as a monopoly.</p>
                <div id="Microsoft"></div>
                <h2><i class="ri-windows-line"></i>MICROSOFT</h2>
                <p>In May 18, 1998 ,the Attorneys General of twenty states (the "States") and the United States Department of Justice ("U.S." or "DOJ") filed complaints against Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), claiming <span class="hightlight">violations of multiple state and federal antitrust laws</span>. In order to <span class="hightlight">avoid irreversible damage to competition in the claimed market for Internet browsers and possible competition in the market for personal computer ("PC") operating systems</span>, the DOJ and the States have separately moved for preliminary injunctions.</p>
                <p>In 2004 European Commission fined Microsoft € 497.2 million because in the EU Microsoft was <span class="hightlight">abusing the market power</span>. Microsoft used its dominant position for <span class="hightlight"></span>making it difficult fot Windows PC’s to work with servers from different companies</span>. In addition, Microsoft <span class="hightlight">bundled Windows Media Player (WMP)</span>, which had competitors, with its widely-used Windows operating system.</p>
                <p>In 2006, Microsoft fined by Korea Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”) about $31 million. Because, <span class="hightlight">integrating its Windows Messenger (WM), Windows Media Player (WMP), and Windows Media Service (WMS) into its Windows operating system</span> for personal computers. In particular, Microsoft was instructed by the KFTC to fully detach WMS from Windows and offer two distinct versions of the operating system: one that comes pre-installed with WMP and WM and another that does not. However, this realization of equal access through the must- carry option is full of practical difficulties: high costs due to various legal and financial problems.</p>
